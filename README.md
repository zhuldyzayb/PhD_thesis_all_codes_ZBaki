This repository contains all the codes used in the PhD thesis "Comprehensive monitoring and prediction of seismicity within the Groningen gas field using large-scale field observations" by Zhuldyzay Baki, University of Twente.
The PhD project is sponsored by NWO and is part of the DeepNL project grant number 2018.033

The repository contains several blocks, with each containing a different part of the research process. Namely, the included parts are:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Preliminary temporal and spatial models
3. Cox rate-and-state model
4. Transformation of NAM dynamic reservoir output into the project grid
The codes for applying the rate-and-state model with the NAM dynamic reservoir model output are not included as they constitute the same code as in pt.3 above, but with different variables.

All the theories behind models and discussions can be found in:
